# reactive_navigation
Developed an autonomous 4-wheel Mars Rover for traversal in unknown Martian terrain and programmed obstacle avoidance and go-to-goal traversal algorithm in Python using GPS, IMU, LIDAR cloud map, and IP camera visual feedback.
Integrated microcontrollers like ESP32 and Arduino Mega, single-board computers like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano, and sensors using the ROS framework.
